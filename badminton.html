	<h1>what is badminton</h1>
	<p style="font-size:25px;"> Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
 Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's.</p>

 <li style="font-size:25px">Badminton Racket</li>
 <p style="font-size:20px">Badminton rackets are available in a variety of materials. This can result in varying combinations of racket weight, balancing points, and string tensions depending on the material used. With so many various combinations to choose from, it will take some time to figure out which is best for your playing style.</p>
 <li style="font-size:25px">Shuttlecock</li>
 <p style="font-size:20px">Plastic and feathered shuttlecocks are the two forms of shuttlecocks.
When opposed to the feathered shuttlecocks that are typically used, plastic shuttlecocks are significantly more robust. Plastic shuttlecocks, on the other hand, are only advised for novices who are just getting started. This is because feathered shuttlecocks are costly and readily fray, especially when handled incorrectly.<br>Because plastic shuttlecocks are heavier, they go fewer distances. As a result, they're great for gaining strength while transitioning to feathered shuttlecocks. Because feathered shuttlecocks are utilised in all competitive competitions, most players will move to utilising them.</p>
 <li  style="font-size:25px">Badminton Shoes</li>
 <p style="font-size:20px">Badminton shoes are designed to give you better traction and grip to stop in time to return a shot. They should also be lightweight have good cushioning to absorb impact when you jump or land.</p>

 <h1>Basic Rules of Badminton</h1>
 <ol type="1">
 <li style="font-size:25px">The court must be 6.1 metres by 13.4 metres in size. The net must be at least 1.55 metres above the ground.</li><br>
 <li style="font-size:25px">The serving player must serve their opponent diagonally across the court. On their side of the court, the players will continue to switch boxes.</li><br>
 <li style="font-size:25px">There are no second serves in badminton, so if you don't get your serve correct, your opponent wins the point.A serve must be underarm and below the waist of the player.</li><br>
 <li style="font-size:25px" >Each game will begin with a coin toss to determine who will serve first and on which side they will begin.
The game is overseen by a referee who sits in a high chair with a 360-degree view of the court.</li><br>
<li style="font-size:25px">Line judges, who keep track of where the shuttle lands in reference to the tram lines, are also required. If the ref disagrees with the line judges, he has the authority to overrule them.</li><br>
<li style="font-size:25px">The games only have two rest periods, one for 90 seconds after the first game and another for 5 minutes after the second game.</li><br>
 </ol>
 <h1>Court</h1>

 <ul style="font-size:25px" >
 <li>The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only. The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length.</li><br>
 <li>When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault. The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.</li>
