	<h1>what is cricket</h1>
	<p style="font-size:25px;"> Cricket is one of the world's oldest team sports. It originated as an unorganised game in the 1200s, with the first significant match taking place in the English county of Sussex in 1697. The popularity of modern cricket is largely owing to British colonialism, which extended the game to nations such as India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, among others.</p>

 <h1>Format of Cricket</h1>
 <p style="font-size:25px;">Test matches, one-day internationals (ODI), and Twenty20 are the three forms. Test matches are games that last four or five days, depending on the regulations that the sides are playing under. ODIs are 50-over matches played on a single day. Each side has 20 overs to score as many runs as they can in 20/20 cricket.Test cricket is the highest level which is played most prominently at the international level. The first test match was played between australia and england.  Australia is the most sucessfull test cricketing nation with 47% wining percentage across their history.Later on, the other two forms were introduced. In 1971, there were ODIs, and in 2003, there were 20/20. Both were offered as a way to entice spectators who did not want to watch the game across several days</p>

 <h1>Basic Rules of Cricket</h1>
 <ol type="1">
 <li style="font-size:25px">The batsman's goal is to score as many runs as possible, which can be achieved by striking four or six times or by sprinting many times.</li><br>
 <li style="font-size:25px">By No Balls, which occurs when a bowler bowls from an incorrect location, bounces twice, or rolls before reaching the batter.</li><br>
 <li style="font-size:25px">Wide balls are declared if the umpire believes the batter has no realistic chance of scoring off the delivery. If the delivery is delivered above the batsman's head, it is not considered a wide, but rather a no ball.</li><br>
 <li style="font-size:25px" >Bowled â€“ According to cricket laws, if the ball hits the wickets of the striking batsman, he is out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the ball). Whether the ball has touched the batsman's bat, gloves, body, or any other part of the batsman is irrelevant.</li><br>
<li style="font-size:25px">)Caught - According to cricket rules, a batsman can be caught out if he hits the ball or even touches it with his bat or his hand/glove holding the bat. The ball is caught on the full by the fielders, wicketkeeper, or bowler (before it bounces)</li><br>
<li style="font-size:25px">Leg Before Wicket (LBW) - If the ball is delivered and the batter is struck first before the bat, an LBW judgement may be made. However, before the umpire may award it, he must consider some of the considerations outlined in the cricket regulations. The umpire must first determine whether the ball would have struck the wickets if the batter had not been present. He can safely dismiss the batsman if his answer is affirmative and the ball was not pitched on the leg side of the wicket.</li><br>
<li style="font-size:25px">Stumped - According to cricket regulations, a batsman can be given out if the wicketkeeper lays down his wicket while out of his crease and without attempting a run. </li><br>
<li style="font-size:25px">Run Out - A batsman is out if no part of his bat or body touches the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly placed down by the fielding side, according to cricket rules.</li><br>
<li style="font-size:25px">Hit Wicket - A batsman is out if he strikes his wicket with his bat or body after the bowler has entered his delivery</li><br>
<li style="font-size:25px">Hit The Ball Twice - According to cricket rules, a batsman is out if he hits a ball twice other than to safeguard his wicket or with the consent of the opposition.</li><br>
