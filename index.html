        <h3>
          Sport (or sports) is all forms of usually competitive physical
          activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use,
          maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing
          entertainment to participants, and in some cases, spectators. There
          are hundreds of sports, ranging from single-player competitions to
          those with hundreds of people playing at the same time, either in
          teams or as individuals. Many competitors may compete concurrently or
          sequentially in certain sports, such as racing, with one winner; in
          others, the contest (a match) is between two teams, each aiming to
          outperform the other. Some sports allow for a "tie" or "draw," in
          which no single winner is determined; others have tie-breaking
          procedures in place to ensure that one winner and one loser are
          determined. In a tournament, a number of competitions may be held in
          order to choose a champion. Many sports leagues select an annual
          champion by scheduling games during a regular season, followed by
          playoffs in certain circumstances.
